#  ChatUnicorn - Fullstack AI Chatbot App

This project is a full-stack AI chatbot application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) alongside Next.js. It leverages OpenRouter (GPT) to enable real-time AI-powered conversations. The interface features a whimsical pastel-pink unicorn theme styled with Tailwind CSS. Users can enjoy multiple chat sessions, persistent chat history, and a responsive user experience across all devices.

## How I Built It - **Integration Overview**
I developed this project as a fun way to deepen my understanding of full-stack development, particularly with modern React (Next.js), REST APIs, and integrating AI services.
I used ChatGPT as a **technical assistant** to:
- Debug tricky API response structures
- Get architecture suggestions for managing chat state
- Explore best practices for folder structures in Next.js
- Generate some UI copy and regex patterns
Everything else â€” from planning to deployment â€” was built and customized by me.
